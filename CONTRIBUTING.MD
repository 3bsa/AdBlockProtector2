This project is in early development, and many things are very user unfriendly. As we want to be able to focus on
development, we currently only accept issues from developers.

You must be able to demonstrate good understanding of web technology, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as
WebExtension system when opening an issue. You must trace the problem yourself and pin point the line of code that is
misbehaving.

No complains are accepted in this repository, if it does not fit you, then fork and leave. Do not ask for expanding
browser support as it does not work on any browser as of now.

We are all volunteers doing this for free, this is not a customer service desk.

You may be banned for breaking this contribution guideline.
